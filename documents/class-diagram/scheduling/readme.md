# Notes
- Sometimes return types are left out, this is in cases where it should be very obvious what it would be.
- _Use_ association are only drawn if we think they would help with the understanding of the system.
- Normal, Composition and Aggregation associations are usually drawn horizontally.
- Extension and implementation associations are usually drawn vertically.
